# COMP210_2_interace_task

Most VR games at the current time are based on First Person Shooters(FPS) as with the current VR technology the headset is the primary
tool for gameplay. I initially aimed to look at how VR technology operates in other game genres, specifically the top down dungeon crawler setting.
This hasn't been done before and I had hoped to gather data to see if there is adequate reason for this or if there was a gap in the market. The prototype I wwas going to create was an adaptation on a top down game I have been working on called Sol Tenebrae, but due to issues with that games base files not being in a functional state I decided to create a new project for this game.

My next idea was to have 2 players perched upon a plank above a volcano fighting with lightsabers, this would have been accomplished by using a plank for the players to stand on, haptic feedback in the controllers when the sabers clashed  and heat fans to simulate the heat that radiates from a volcano. 


Looking around, I had noticed that this lightsaber idea had been done time and time again; most notably Lightblade VR 
(Â£2.79 - Steam)

So I decided to try and come up with something more innovative and that project ended with a very basic project design that only had singular lightsaber functionality

Lastly and finally I moved onto the current project, Xtreme Fishing.
There are three goals I wish to attain in this game to make it more enjoyable by the player. The first is a usable fishing pole, so that 
the player is able to pick up a fishing rod and also catch fish with it.
An element of danger, this will be either fish jumping out of the water at the player requiring the player to dodge, or the player falling off the plank and needing to balance. To avoid inducing motion sickness I think I will go with the player dodging fish.
Lastly, a score which will end the game in an appropriate manner.

## User stories
#### As a player I would like to feel as though I'm using a fishing pole
The controller is similar to how a fishing pole feels in reality. A stick attached to the Vive controllers with some weights on the end of the stick to emulate weight on the bob from the water/fish.

#### As a player I would like to be able to move along the bridge
The bridge has a small zone in which the player can traverse. This navigable area will be roughly the same size as the plank used in the
prototype.

#### As a player I would like to be able to know how many fish I have caught
The User Interface will display a number next to a fish icon which dictates how many fish have been caught so far.

#### As a player I want to feel like I need to dodge the fish
If the player does not dodge the fish then they will lose points (fish) and the controllers will vibrate accompanied by a red vignette around the screen.

#### As a player I would like incentive to catch the fish
The game features a scoring system to give competition with others who have played the game before the player.

#### As a player I would like to know when a fish has been caught by a hook
The controllers will vibrate when coming into contact with a fish, so the player knows when to reel in the fishing line.

#### As a player I want the fish to be in different places each time to increase the difficulty
The fish spawn in different places everytime, the chances of getting the same fish layout in any game is less than 1 in a quattuordecillion.
