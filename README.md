Most VR games at the current time are based on First Person Shooters(FPS) as with the current VR technology the headset is the primary
tool for gameplay. I aim to look at how VR technology operates in other game genres, specifically the top down dungeon crawler setting.
This hasn't been done before and I hope to gather data to see if there is adequate reason for this or if there's a gap in the market. The prototype I will create should be fun, functional and fast (fast in the sense that any movements dictated by the player should be updated ASAP)
